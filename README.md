# Must-cared Multi-label Papers #

This is a list of some important multi-label learning that serious students and researches working in the field should probably know about and read.

This list is far from complete or objective, and is evolving, as important papers are being published year after year. Please let me know via [pull requests](https://github.com/XSilverBullet/Multi-label-Paper/pulls "pull requests") and [issues](https://github.com/XSilverBullet/Multi-label-Paper/issues "issues") if anything is missing.

Also, I did not try to include links to original papers since there is a lot of work to keep dead links up to date. I'm sure most of the papers listed here via a single Google search by their titles.

A paper does not have to be a peer-reviewed conference/journal paper to appear here. We also include tutial/survey-style papers and blog posts that often eaiser to understand than the original papers.
